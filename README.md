# Road Construction Analysis in Poland

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the status and length of roads under construction in Poland, categorized by the type of road (e.g., A1, A2) and their current stage of development (e.g., realization, preparation). The goal of the analysis is to provide insights into the infrastructure development trends, focusing on road networks.

## Dataset Information

The project includes the following datasets:

1. **Average Spending by Purpose of Visit**: Data related to spending, though not directly used in road analysis, offers potential for further economic investigation.
2. **Drogi i Długości**: This dataset contains road numbers and their total lengths for various road types.
3. **Info About Particular Road**: Provides detailed information on individual road sections, including length and stage of completion.
4. **Łączna Długość**: Total length of roads currently under construction in the realization stage.
5. **Sumaryczna Długość Dróg na Poszczególnych Etapach**: Summarizes road lengths at different stages of development (planning, preparation, realization).

## Key Insights

- **Total Road Length in Realization**: The total length of roads currently in the realization stage is 1616.13 km.
- **Road Length by Type**: Major roads such as A4 (456.77 km) and S19 (428.61 km) have the longest sections under construction.
- **Stage Analysis**: A significant portion of road development is in the realization stage, indicating strong ongoing investment in infrastructure.
- **Road Details**: Specific road sections, including expansions and new developments, such as A1 and A2, highlight the focus on national road infrastructure.

## Visualizations

Several key visualizations were created to present the analysis:

1. **Długość dróg według typu**: A bar chart showing road length by type.
2. **Całkowita długość dróg na poszczególnych etapach realizacji**: Comparison of road lengths at different construction stages.
